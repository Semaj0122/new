        Starry Night is one of the most recognized pieces of art in the world. It is absolutely everywhere, too.
         It can be seen on coffee, mugs, t-shirts, towels, magnets, etc. Honestly, it sometimes feels as if the painting’s fame has exceeded that of its creator.
          It is a magnificent piece of art. That Starry Night resonates with so many people is a testament to how its beauty is timeless and universal.

        Johannes Vermeer is one of the most famous Dutch painters of the 17th century. He is famous for his intimate household scenes with amazing light. In other paintings by Vermeer, such as the famous Girl with a Pearl Earring and View of Delft, he managed to create a calm, almost timeless atmosphere.
         Vermeer always spent a long time on every painting, so he did not complete many pictures. We know of only 36 paintings by him. Vermeer was also an art dealer and valuer.

            Rembrandt’s <i>The Night Watch</i> is an example of a very specific type of painting that was exclusive to the Northern Netherlands, with the majority being commissioned in the city of Amsterdam. It is a group portrait of a company of civic guardsmen. The primary purpose of these guardsmen was to serve as defenders of their cities. As such, they were tasked with guarding gates, policing streets, putting out fires, and generally maintaining order throughout the city.
             Additionally, they were an important presence at parades held for visiting royalty as well and other festive occasions.
